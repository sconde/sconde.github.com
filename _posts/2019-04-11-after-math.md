I spent nearly 10 years at Umass Dartmouth - dual B.S. in computational math and Accounting; Ph.D. in EAS, Computational Science and Engineering.
This week, I returned as an alumni give an hour talk about some of research and an overview of what I spend my time on as a postdoc at the lab.

Moreover, I was one of four recent alumni panelists for this year's "After Math" symposium. [The poster for the event can be found here.](https://www.umassd.edu/media/umassdartmouth/mathematics/amsmedia/AMS_Poster_Spring2019.pdf)

It was truly a great experience to talk to some of the brightest undergraduates in the department. The event made me even more determined to succeed. 

I have so many awesome professors and mentors that truly cared for my well-being and future. I thank [Alfa Heryudono](http://www.math.umassd.edu/~aheryudono/) everyday for recruiting me into the [CSUMS](https://compmath.wordpress.com/) program. More importantly, I will forever be grateful for him for convincing me not to quit the program on a number of occasions. I have learned so much from him: academically, scientifically, and how to live my life the best way possible.

I only wish I could help inspire someone find their way as Alfa did for me. This is my motivation for participant in programs like ["STEAM the STREETS](https://bigpictureanthems.com/steam-the-streets/)."
