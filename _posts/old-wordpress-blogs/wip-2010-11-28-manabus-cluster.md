My friend and I put together an openMPI cluster using the old iMac from the math department. This was part of our CSUMS research project. We wrote a proposal and everything.

One of the requirements is to have an assessment report of the cluster. Since this is the first year the cluster is running, we are told to include the following:
<blockquote>a. Why would you want a parallel cluster
b. How did you take the machines and configure them into
a cluster (software/hardware issues)
c. Step by step tutorial on how to do this
d. demonstrate the cluster running a code in parallel -- nice
to see same code on 1 node, 2 nodes, 4 nodes, 8 nodes, 16 nodes.</blockquote>
YAY!!! :)

Not really, I have so much on my plate. And quite frankly, I am also facing some person issues at the moment that has my occupied my attention. Anyway, we decided to write couple of parallel codes and see how they perform on Manabus.

Well the cluster run in parallel. Its very sad though, the school network in somewhat impeding the performance of our cluster. There are so much traffic and also the switch we using is not that "AWESOME". But hey, we requested the cluster so that we may have the resources to learn and create parallel algorithms and codes. So we can't complain.

The plan: Use manabus to write and debug parallel MPI codes.
