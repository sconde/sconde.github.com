I do a lot of self-learning. I'm online educated. I'm a tinkerer. I'm a builder. If I want to figure
out how to do something, I build it!


- I am a graduate student working under the advice of Sigal Gottlieb and Alfa R.H. Heryudono (Umass Dartmouth).
- I received my Bachelor's degree in Computational Mathematics and Accounting in 2012 from Umass Dartmouth.
- I am interested in Numerical Analysis, Scientific Computing, HPC and Computational Finance.
