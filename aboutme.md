I do a lot of self-learning. I'm online educated. I'm a tinkerer. I'm a builder. If I want to figure
out how to do something, I build it!


Iâ€™m Generally a curious person - always seeking to learn new things and meet intellectual people.
My purpose is self improvement.
I found that I'm the happiest when I can learn new things and then apply them in practice or teach them to others.
In my limited free time, I am learning more about coding, IoT and A.I.
