I was motivated by the exceptional work of [yaohuaxu](https://github.com/yaohuaxu/CppND-Capstone-Snake-Game) using the **A-Star** algorithm to help the player play the game. I decided to use the A-Stat algorithm I had written and attempt to automate the game. 

While the first attempt at automation was somewhat successful, I noticed a little issue with the periodic boundary condition. This made me update the code further to also allow user interaction to "aid" solve the game faster.

Current limitations and potential upgrades are listed in the issues.
