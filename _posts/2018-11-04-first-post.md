I'm back, how exciting! I miss blogging!!  My hope is to restart blogging and share my scientific explorations.

Back in undergrad (maybe a little in grad school), I used my blog posts as a way to chronicle my scientific quests and learning explorations. Lately, I've realized that I miss the experience and wanted to get back into it. The big question prior to restarting: which platform should I use? I finally decided to migrate my Wordpress blog to Jekyll and host on Github Pages.

## Why make the move?

Similar to many other bloggers who have made the switch, I've acknowledged the advantage of moving to Jekyll:

1. Jekyll allows markdown: I can write all my post in simple markdown and not have to suffer navigating HTML tags
2. Writing code snippets is very easier in markdown!!
3. Hosting in Github: free hosting, and of course, having version control is awesome.
4. [I can include Jupyter Notebooks in Jekyll posts](https://briancaffey.github.io/2016/03/14/ipynb-with-jekyll.html)
5. [I can deploy R Markdown in Jekyll posts](https://selbydavid.com/2017/06/16/rmarkdown-jekyll/)

Similar to Wordpress, there are many [Jekyll themes](https://drjekyllthemes.github.io/) worth exploring. I decided to use the [Beautiful Jekyll theme.](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/)
All posts prior to this one are selected and migrated from my [old wordpress blog: My Mathematical Exploration.](https://mathrule.wordpress.com/). As I find the time, I do intend on editing and expending on most (if not all) of these posts.
