The profile video summarizes my path. Hopefully it encourages one or two kids from my neighborhood, similar neighborhood and/or background, to not hide their love for STEM and to start exploring as early as possible.

[#STEAMtheStreets](https://bigpictureanthems.com/steam-the-streets/) is inspiring and activating underrepresented youth to pursue STEM / STEAM career pathways.


I obtained my PhD in Engineering and Applied Science with a focus in Computational Science and Engineering from Umass Dartmouth in 2012. Also from Umass Dartmouth, I hold two B.S. in Accounting and Computational Mathematics.

I am now continuing my career at the Center for Computing Research at Sandia National Lab. I am fortunate to be a member of of the research group focusing on parallel computing, implicit methods, MHD, plasma, and multi physics. My research focus at the lab includes: high performance computing, and parallel algorithm development, numerical methods for multiple-time-scale nonlinear coupled PDEs, temporal and spatial discretizations of PDEs, applications to computational fluid dynamics, and magnetohydrodynamic systems modeling.
