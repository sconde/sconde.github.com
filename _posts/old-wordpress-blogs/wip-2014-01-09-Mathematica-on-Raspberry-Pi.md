<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/5282">Mathematica has graciously offered Mathematica free on Raspberry Pi</a>. To All who loves free stuff, this is one of the best gift to most and all of the openSource community. I am was elated to hear about it and embarked on a course install and test out this gift.

With the appropriate command line (found on the page above), I was able to acquire Mathematica Verison 10
```bash
~ $ /opt/Wolfram/WolframEngine/10.0/
```

After installation, Wolfram should be located under the 'Education menu' in the app launcher. This brings up the engine in a terminal. According to the multiply forums, I should be able to get Mathematica in a GUI form. The GUI wasn't located where it should be.

This is confirmed from within Wolfram
```bash
 ~ $ wolfram

Of course I tried seeing if this engine was available on <a href="http://www.udoo.org/features/">UDOO</a>Â but it wasn't. Oops, wishful thinking
