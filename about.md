I am currently pursuing my PhD in Engineering and Applied Science with a focus in Computational Science. I have my BS in Computational Mathematics and Accounting. I started undergraduate as an Accounting major. I later decided to go Computational Mathematics for the challenge. 
<!--It is the same drive for challenge and knowledge that I have started enrolling in Coursera courses.-->
