    title: About Me
    summary: |
        I'm a computational scientist. I'm a tinkerer. I'm a builder. If I want to figure out how to do something, I build it.

        In 2010, I built an OpenMPI cluster in my friend's basement. Since then I've worked on time integration methods for plasma simulations, parallel algorithms for HPC systems, scientific machine learning, and ML/AI performance optimization.

        I work in HPC and ML/AI optimization - training, inference, and all-around performance optimization. I get to combine mathematics, computational methods, and solving hard problems. I'm interested in using AI and machine learning to transform big data into real-world solutions.

        I do a lot of self-learning. I'm online educated. I'm generally a curious person - always seeking to learn new things and meet intellectual people. My purpose is self improvement.

        I'm happiest when I can learn something new and then apply it in practice or teach it to others. That's why I keep this blog: to document what I learn and share it with anyone who might find it useful.

        The most important work I do isn't in any paper or codebase. It's my involvement with [STEAM the Streets](http://bigpictureanthems.com/steam-the-streets/). We inspire and activate underrepresented youth to pursue STEM and STEAM career pathways. I grew up in Fall River, MA. I know firsthand how important it is for kids from underrepresented backgrounds to see that they belong in these fields and to have people who can show them the way.
